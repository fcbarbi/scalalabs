Author: fcbarbi@gmail.com 
Update: July 2019  

This is a list of classes/exercises in Scala for our course in data analysis.

## 1. Lab 01. Setup tools, libraries and development enviornment

Check the version of Scala, as of this writing the current version is 
```
$ scalac -version
Scala compiler version 2.13.0 -- Copyright 2002-2019, LAMP/EPFL and Lightbend, Inc.
```

* TIP: Easier way to install/update using Brew: `brew update` and `bre install scala` or `brew upgrade scala`. 

* TIP: IntelliJ is a great IDE but we will use it later, now you have to know the path for manual compilation.

## 2. Lab 02. Finance Calculator

## 3. Lab 03. Simulation for stochastic methods 

## 4. Lab 04. Filtering and Smoothing
